## 🏁 Final Remarks

The completion of Week 0 marks the successful setup of the development environment required for the program.

This week primarily focused on:

- Installation of the essential tools,
- Verifying proper configurations, and
- Documenting the entire process for reproducibility.

Although certain challenges were encountered during the setup, they provided valuable learning experiences in debugging and problem-solving within a Linux environment.
