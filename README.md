# Week 1: Introduction to RTL Design Flow.
 
The focus of this week is on **understanding the complete RTL design flow.**

---

## üìë Objectives
- Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis.
- Day 2: Timing Libraries, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis, and Efficient Flip-Flop coding styles.
- Day 3: Combinational and Sequencial Optimizations.

## üèÅ Final Remarks

 <!--- The completion of Week 0 marks the successful setup of the development environment required for the program.

This week primarily focused on:

- Installation of the essential tools,
- Verifying proper configurations, and
- Documenting the entire process for reproducibility.

Although certain challenges were encountered during the setup, they provided valuable learning experiences in debugging and problem-solving within a Linux environment.-->
